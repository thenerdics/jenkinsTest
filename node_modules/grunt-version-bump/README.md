#Overview
A grunt plugin for bumping a version property in JSON files

#Getting Started
The plugin requires Grunt ~0.4.2

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-version-bump --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-version-bump');
```

## The "version_bump" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `version_bump`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  version_bump: {
    files: ['package.json', 'component.json', 'somefile.txt']
  }
});

```

## Usage

```js
grunt version_bump
```
There is a default version string structure, but you can provide your own structure.

By default, the part with the lowest priority gets bumped. In the default version string structure that would be the **build** part.

You can specify a different increment type in 1st argument:
```js
grunt version_bump:[incrementType]
```
The default version string structure pattern is
```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<stage>.<build>
```
Available increment types provided in the default version string strucutre:<br>
Let's assume current version is 1.2.3-SNAPSHOT.4
```javascript
    grunt version_bump:major // 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.1
    grunt version_bump:build // 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.2
    grunt version_bump:minor // 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.1
    grunt version_bump:build // 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.2
    grunt version_bump:patch // 2.1.1-SNAPSHOT.1
    grunt version_bump:build // 2.1.1-SNAPSHOT.2
    grunt version_bump:stage // 2.1.0-alpha.1
    grunt version_bump:build // 2.1.0-alpha.2
    grunt version_bump:stage // 2.1.0-beta.1
    grunt version_bump:stage // 2.1.0-RELEASE.1
    grunt version_bump:major --condition=stage:alpha // 2.1.0-RELEASE.1
    grunt version_bump:major --condition=minor:1 // 2.2.0-RELEASE.1
```
As can be seen, bumping a part results in resetting all parts of lower priority. The priority order of the default version string strcuture is **major**, **minor**, **stage**, **patch**, **build**.

### Settings

#### files
Type: `String|Array`  
Default: `['package.json']`

File paths of the meta file(s) you wish to operate on.

#### incrementType
Type: `String`  

The part to increment. Must be defined in the version string structure.

#### versionStructureFile
Type: `String`  

File path to the version structure file if you wish to override the default.

#### versionStructure
Type: `JSON`

A content of a version strcuture. An array of objects with the following fields:
##### name
Type: `String`

The name of the part

##### prefix
Type: `String`
Default: `.`

A string to put before the part

##### order
Type: `Integer`

The order of the part in the version string. Must be consecutive.

##### priority
Type: `Integer`

The priority of the part in the version string. Must be consecutive. 1 is for the highest priority.

##### resettable
Type: `Boolean`

Whether or not the part should be reset if a higher priority part was requested to be bumped.

##### resetTo
Type: `Integer`
Default: 0

The number to use when resetting a resettable part.

##### values
Type: `Array`

Array of strings ordered by priority of possible values for that part if numbers are not good enough.

#### callback
Type: `Function`

Callback function after successfully job, in parameter is set name of new version.

### Command Line Options
#### condition
Type `String:String`

## Issues
Please use the [github issues list](https://github.com/xl8/grunt-coffeelinter/issues) to report any issues. If possible, please include a link to an open github repo with the smallest failing example of your issue. Even better, fork the project, create a failing test case and issue a pull request with the issue number referenced in the pull request. Super better, fork the project create a failing test case, fix the problem, and issue a pull request with the test and fix referencing the issue number.
